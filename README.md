# Advent of Code 2022

Putting this on github to make sure I actually complete my breakfast coding every morning :)

See more about the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

The puzzles will be organized in folders with a brief description, my train of thought, and my code - using python to reduce boilerplate.
